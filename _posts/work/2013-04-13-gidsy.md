<h2>Making the Perfect Listing</h2>
<h3>Visual Design, Interaction Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <video id="making_the_perfect_listing" class="browser_img" title="Making the Perfect Listing - Gidsy.com"
    preload="auto" width="640" height="400" poster="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/PerfectListing.jpg" data-setup="{}">
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/PerfectListing.mp4" type='video/mp4'>

</div>

With the initial launch of Gidsy, we decided to make a fun & engaging <em>Getting Started</em> guide for organizers. The project was a great success and generated a lot of traffic for our brand new product.

<h2>City Pages</h2>
<h3>Project Management, Product Strategy, Product Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <img src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/nyc-gidsy.jpg" class="browser_img" title="New York City Activity Guide - Gidsy.com" />
</div>

City pages are landing pages for those looking for activities in specific locations in search engines. Gidsy's most popular locations each have their own page showing dynamic content based on relevance, in addition to editorial content with SEO juicy keywords. One month after launch, the <em>Berlin city page became one of the top 10 landing pages</em> for the site.

<h2>Event booking</h2>
<h3>Project Management, Product Strategy, Product Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <video id="booking_flow" class="browser_img" title="Select event - Gidsy.com"
    preload="auto" width="640" height="400" poster="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/bookingflow.png"
    data-setup="{}">
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/bookingflow.mp4" type='video/mp4'>
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/bookingflow.webm" type='video/webm'>
  </video>
</div>

This redesign combined two booking steps, the event selection and pricing overview, into a single page. With simple interactions and painless flow, <em>booking conversions increased by nearly 5%</em>.
