.app.icns is a project created together with <a href="http://kara-z.com">Kara Zichittella</a>. It's an exploration of shape, color, and minimalism. We wanted to see how far we could reduce the hyper-realistic icons, while maintaining recognition. To our delight the result was quite pleasing, and continued with periodic releases due to popular demand.

The project is presented in an equally simple, yet unique interface.
