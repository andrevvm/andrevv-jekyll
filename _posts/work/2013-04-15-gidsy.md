Joining Gidsy in June 2011 as the first employee of the company, I helped shape the product from the beginning. Working closely with the CPO and CTO, Iâ€™ve maintained a flexible role, adapting to the needs of the company and the users. Responsibilities include product strategy, project management, visual design, UI/UX design, interaction design, metrics and web development.

Here are select projects I've contributed to while at Gidsy.

<h2>Making the Perfect Listing</h2>
<h3>Visual Design, Interaction Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <video id="making_the_perfect_listing" class="browser_img" title="Making the Perfect Listing - Gidsy.com"
    preload="auto" width="100%" height="405" poster="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/PerfectListing.jpg">
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/PerfectListing.mp4" type='video/mp4'>
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/PerfectListing.webm" type='video/webm'>
  </video>
</div>

With the initial launch of Gidsy, we decided to make a fun & engaging <em>Getting Started</em> guide for organizers. The project was a great success and generated a lot of traffic for our brand new product.

<h2>City Pages</h2>
<h3>Project Management, Product Strategy, Product Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <img src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/nyc-gidsy.jpg" class="browser_img" title="New York City Activity Guide - Gidsy.com" />
</div>

City pages are landing pages for those looking for activities in specific locations in search engines. Gidsy's most popular locations each have their own page showing dynamic content based on relevance, in addition to editorial content with SEO juicy keywords. One month after launch, the <em>Berlin city page became one of the top 10 landing pages</em> for the site.

<h2>Event booking</h2>
<h3>Project Management, Product Strategy, Product Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <video id="booking_flow" class="browser_img" title="Select event - Gidsy.com"
    preload="auto" width="100%" height="405" poster="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/bookingflow.png"
    data-setup="{}">
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/bookingflow.mp4" type='video/mp4'>
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/bookingflow.webm" type='video/webm'>
  </video>
</div>

This redesign combined two booking steps, the event selection and pricing overview, into a single page. With simple interactions and painless flow, <em>booking conversions increased by nearly 5%</em>.

<h2>Widgets</h2>
<h3>Product Strategy, Product Design, Web Development</h3>

<div>
  <img src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/widgets-gidsy.jpg" class="browser_img" title="Edit Listing - Gidsy.com" />
</div>

After recognizing that many organizers had their own blogs or websites for their activities, we introduced widgets as a tool for promotion. The design is subtle and integrates seemlessly to most websites, but still maintains the Gidsy brand. Since project launch, widgets have contributed to <em>13.3% of total revenue</em>.

<h2>Explorers League</h2>
<h3>Visual Design, Product Design, Web Development</h3>

<p class="text-center">
  <img src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/explorers_badges.png" />
</p>

<div>
  <video id="explorers_league" class="browser_img" title="Gidsy Explorers League - Gidsy.com"
    preload="auto" width="100%" height="400" poster="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/explorers.png">
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/explorers.mp4" type='video/mp4'>
    <source src="{{ site.root }}/work/gidsy/explorers.webm" type='video/webm'>
  </video>
</div>

The Explorers League is Gidsy's version of an ambassador program. We selected certain users and gave them responsibilities and rewards on the platform. This page was created to highlight and celebrate our dedicated users.

<h3>Visual Design</h3>

<p class="text-center">
