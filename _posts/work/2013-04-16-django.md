Django is an open source web framework, used to build web apps big and small, including Pinterest, Rdio and The Guardian. Their website was outdated, with a 10 year old look and feel. I updated the visual design with fresher colors, ample whitespace and clear typography, while maintaining a familiarity to the documentation that thousands of developers rely on daily. A web styleguide was also created to help the foundation contributors maintain consistency for further Django related endeavors.
