<em>Berlin Community Radio</em> was an online radio station presenting everything that is coming from, passing through or influencing the creative scene in Berlin. I helped them out with a design of their relauched website on a tight budget.

<p>
  The animated gif of their logo was created by analog distortions of a flatbed scanner.

<p><em>Berlin Community Radio</em> closed its doors in February 2019.</p>
