A custom Tumblr theme for the launch of the pop star's shoe collaboration, with a rotating 3D panoramic collage background and floating GIFs. The project went awry when she <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2932190/Iggy-Azalea-lashes-Steve-Madden-release-disgusting-photo-shoot-promote-shoe-line-without-knowledge.html" rel="external">threw a fit</a> on social media about some of the photos, and the site was promptly deleted.
