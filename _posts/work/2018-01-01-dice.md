DICE is a festival & conference in Berlin, featuring female, trans & nonbinary people in music. With a custom typeface and art direction by <a href="http://zeitype.com/" rel="external">Zeitype</a>, the identity is brought to life with a color-shifting, dynamic blob. High-res exports and recordings of the shape are also used for posters and promotional material.
