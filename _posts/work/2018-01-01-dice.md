DICE is a festival & conference in Berlin which aims to elevate vital and innovative voices whose contributions to the artistic field are underrepresented. With art direction by Danielle Kourtesis and custom typeface by <a href="http://zeitype.com/" rel="external">Zeitype</a>, the identity is brought to life with a color-shifting, dynamic blob. High-res exports and recordings of the shape are also used for posters and other promotional material.
